### Introduction
HR Data Analysis is the process of collecting, analyzing, and interpreting data related to human resources in an organization. The goal is to use this data to make informed decisions about hiring, employee performance, retention, training, and overall workforce management.
It involves working with data like:
- Employee demographics (age, gender, location).
- Job roles and departments.
- Hiring and attrition rates.
- Performance evaluations.
- Employee engagement surveys
  
By applying data analysis techniques, HR teams can identify trends, forecast future workforce needs, measure the impact of HR initiatives, and improve employee satisfaction and productivity. Tools like Excel, Power BI, Python, and HR-specific platforms (like Workday or SAP SuccessFactors) are commonly used in HR data analysis
